How this repo works & what it contains:
 - Created with:
 - Html
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap5 Framework
 - Sass (SCSS)
 - PHP

Bootstrap5:
 - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/

What needs work:

Brothers Page - 
 - Responsive Issue
 - Videos not loading on devices with low ram/processing speed
 - Solution: For screens lower than mobile size px by px change video to image.
  
Lineage Page -
 - Needs an overhaul from old website
 - Issue: Making a new tree responsive may be difficult :skull-emoji:

For Sujal: 
 - Learn how Bootstrap5 styling framework works (please read docs).
 - Learn how HTML, CSS, JS works
 - Learn how site responsiveness works (most important)
 - Right now just focus on how to update the website and make basic changes. Later we will figure out the google bucket situation and other stuff.

 Site Responsiveness: 
 - Not how fast a site reacts but how a site reacts to changes in screen size.
 - Most website designs may look terrible on mobile if site isnt responding reponsively.

 Task for Sujal:
 - For brothers page, when screen size is below "x" change video to class image.
