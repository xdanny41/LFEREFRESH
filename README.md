**HELLO LAMBDA CS NERDS. This is the Official Repository for Lambda Phi Epsilon | Alpha Phi Chapter at THE University of Oklahoma.**

**General Advice:** 
- This site is setup in a way where novice CS Lambda Students can learn how to effectively: 
- Manage a site, Learn how cloud containerization works, general git practice, Learn new languages such as, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Learn how to use frameworks & styling: Bootstrap5 and how to generally make new additions/modules & pages to the existing website.
- If you want to make your own site, I highly recommend you make it from scratch with more people so that you can have something on your resume.
- Active house will sometimes make retarded request. You may choose to uphold the request at your own risk.


**How this repo works & what it contains:**
 - Created with:
 - Html
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap5 Framework
 - Sass (SCSS)
 - PHP

**Bootstrap5:**
 - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/

**What needs work:**

Brothers Page - 
 - Responsive Issue
 - Videos not loading on devices with low ram/processing speed
 - Solution: For screens lower than mobile size px by px change video to image.
  
Lineage Page -
 - Needs an overhaul from old website
 - Issue: Making a new tree responsive may be difficult :skull-emoji:

**For Webmster:**
 - Learn how Bootstrap5 styling framework works (please read docs).
 - Learn how HTML, CSS, JS works
 - Learn how site responsiveness works (most important)
 - Right now just focus on how to update the website and make basic changes. Later we will figure out the google bucket situation and other stuff.

 Site Responsiveness: 
 - Not how fast a site reacts but how a site reacts to changes in screen size.
 - Most website designs may look terrible on mobile if site isnt responding reponsively.

 Task for Webmaster:
 - For brothers page, when screen size changes to mobile, remove video and add class photo (refer to Example file).
 - Add links to social buttons on front-page.

 **General Maintainence:** 
 - Have google crawl new site.
 - Update Site XML.
 - Figure out how to send in a contact-form to an email using PHP. Having issues with GCP so not sure if this is possible on cloud storage :sad-face: 


**Contact Me:**
 - In any case you "the webmaster" is having any trouble with the website, please refer to the OULambdas Contact Sheet and text me.
